-----> WHAT ?

Osmo is a handy personal organizer which includes calendar, tasks manager and 
address book modules. It was designed to be a small, easy to use and good 
looking PIM tool to help to manage personal information. In current state the 
organizer is quite convenient in use - for example, user can perform nearly all 
operations using keyboard. Also, a lot of parameters are configurable to meet 
user preferences. On the technical side, Osmo is GTK+ based tool which use plain 
XML database to store all personal data.

Currently, Osmo has the following features:

    * Calendar:
          o note per day
          o arbitrary coloring of the days with notes
          o date calculator
          o built-in full year calendar
          o 'jump to date' function
          o compact mode (run as 'osmo -cal')
          o handy popup menu for month change
          o integration with Tasks and Contacts modules
    * Tasks:
          o category filter
          o priority per task
          o date dependent task color
          o hide/unhide complete tasks
    * Contacts:
          o 'find as you type' support
          o robust search functionality
          o photo support
          o import/export support for CSV files 
          o optional export to XHTML format

Please note that works in progress, so you can expect much more features 
(remainder, .ics parser, etc.) in the future.
