-----> WHAT ?

Osmo is a handy personal organizer which includes calendar, tasks manager and 
address book modules. It was designed to be a small, easy to use and good 
looking PIM tool to help to manage personal information. In current state the 
organizer is quite convenient in use - for example, user can perform nearly all 
operations using keyboard. Also, a lot of parameters are configurable to meet 
user preferences. On the technical side, Osmo is GTK+ based tool which use plain 
XML database to store all personal data.

Currently, Osmo has the following features:

    * Calendar:
          o note per day
          o built-in full year calendar
          o 'jump to date' function
          o compact mode (run as 'osmo -cal')
          o rudimental integration with Tasks and Contacts modules
    * Tasks:
          o category filter
          o priority per task
          o date dependent task color
          o hide/unhide complete tasks
    * Contacts:
          o 'find as you type' support
          o robust search functionality
          o photo support
          o import/export support for CSV files 
          o optional export to XHTML format

Please note that works in progress, so you can expect much more features 
(remainder, .ics parser, etc.) in the future.

Any suggestions, patches, criticism are kindly welcome.
