-----> WHAT ?

Osmo is a handy personal organizer, which includes calendar, tasks manager and 
address book modules. It was designed to be a small, easy to use and good 
looking PIM tool to help to manage personal information. In its current state the 
organizer is quite convenient to use - for example, the user can perform nearly all
operations using the keyboard. Also, a lot of parameters are configurable to meet 
the user's preferences. On the technical side, Osmo is GTK+ based tool which uses
a plain XML database to store all personal data.
